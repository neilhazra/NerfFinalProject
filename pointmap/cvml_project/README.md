# Computer Vision and ML Projects
This repository contains snippets of code on computer vision and machine learning. The objective is to provide easy to run
code for learning concepts. 

### Requirement
Standard Anaconda packages. Additional requirements in individual projects

- [ML Theory](theory)

- Projections
    - [backprojection](projections/inverse_projection)
    - [ipm](projections/ipm)
    - [lidar-camera](projections/lidar_camera_projection)

- Image Transformation
    - [Similarity](image_transformation)

- Detection
    - [Non-maximum Suppression](detection)
   
- Depth Estimation
    - [self-supervised SFM](depth/self_supervised_sfm)
